    title: "My first Rust project",
    description: `This weekend, I decided to dive into the Rust programming language, fueled by curiosity and the desire to learn something new.
    Conveniently, my workplace had an internal learning session on neural networks, sparking an idea to implement one from scratch using Rust.
    Now, keep in mind, this was my time writing Rust code, so I probably made bunch of rookie mistakes... Over the project, I learned Rust's unique concepts like Borrow, Ownership, and Traits â€“ a far cry from the comfort of C++, Java, or Python that I'm used to.
    Despite the code quirks and inevitable head-scratching, it was great learning experience!
