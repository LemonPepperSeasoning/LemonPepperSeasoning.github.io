                    <p>
                        Takahiro Ishiguro built the Hasha app as a Free app.
                        This service is provided by Takahiro Ishiguro at no
                        cost and is intended for use as is.

                        This page is used to inform visitors regarding my
                        policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of
                        Personal Information if anyone decided to use my
                        Service.

                        If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the
                        collection and use of information in relation to this
                        policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used
                        for providing and improving the Service. I will not use
                        or share your information with anyone except as
                        described in this Privacy Policy.

                        The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same
                        meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which are
                        accessible at Hasha unless otherwise defined in this
                        Privacy Policy.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="h3">Information Collection and Use</h3>

                    <p>
                        Hasha does not collect any personal information from
                        the user, the only data which is collected is the
                        default data made available through Apple via the App
                        Store Connect (crashes, downloads, App Store analytics,
                        and usage). This basic data is not shared with any
                        third parties or linked to your identity.
                    </p>


                    <h3 class="h3">Cookies</h3>

                    <p>
                        Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
                        commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These
                        are sent to your browser from the websites that you
                        visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.

                        This Service does not use these “cookies”.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="h3">Service Providers</h3>

                    <p>
                        I may employ third-party companies and individuals due
                        to the following reasons:

                        * To facilitate our Service;
                        * To provide the Service on our behalf;
                        * To perform Service-related services; or
                        * To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.

                        I want to inform users of this Service that these third
                        parties have access to their Personal Information. The
                        reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our
                        behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or
                        use the information for any other purpose.
                    </p>


                    <h3 class="h3">Security</h3>

                    <p>
                        I value your trust in providing us your Personal
                        Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
                        acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no
                        method of transmission over the internet, or method of
                        electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I
                        cannot guarantee its absolute security.
                    </p>


                    <h3 class="h3">Links to Other Sites</h3>

                    <p>
                        This Service does not contain links to other sites.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="h3">Children’s Privacy</h3>

                    <p>
                        I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable
                        information from children. I encourage all children to
                        never submit any personally identifiable information
                        through the Application and/or Services. I encourage
                        parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's
                        Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by
                        instructing their children never to provide personally
                        identifiable information through the Application and/or
                        Services without their permission. If you have reason
                        to believe that a child has provided personally
                        identifiable information to us through the Application
                        and/or Services, please contact us. You must also be at
                        least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of
                        your personally identifiable information in your
                        country (in some countries we may allow your parent or
                        guardian to do so on your behalf).
                    </p>


                    <h3 class="h3">Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>

                    <p>
                        I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time.
                        Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically
                        for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by
                        posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

                        This policy is effective as of 2022-09-29.
                    </p>
